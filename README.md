# jenkins-shared-lib-client
Jenkins file which uses jenkins shared library

Individual projects would contain one of these, to consume the [jenkins-shared-lib](https://github.com/sigitas-plk/jenkins-shared-lib)

Ideally, this file should also contain project specific config in regard to build. e.g. build folder, nexus artifact id ect.
